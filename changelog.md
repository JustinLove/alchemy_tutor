# Alchemy Tutor Changelog

## 0.1.0

- Went ahead and added Alchemical Reactions Expansion recipes, since I wanted to start testing them
- As part of the above, made some major updates; there are new fast detector types which should improve several formula; things that were impractical before can now usually trigger a chest - including cooking meat.
- Also as part of expansion, added a rating system so new recipes can sort in appropriately; this resulted in many formula being reordered.
- Added formula for salt and brine, since ARE has a salt formula.
- Formula that need to start a fire now provide a torch wand instead of a fire potion.
- The fungi garden provides garden shears in case you don't have a good spell on your wands
- Attempt to fix occasional disappearance of coal pits containers when activated.
- Tweak potion height in vault horiz.
- Remove left barrier in first level horiz.
- jungle pit is made of dense steel, which does not melt to mana.
- offset material checkers to reduce simultaneous success.
- removed cables from hisii base horiz.
