solids:
concrete - cement + water
rock - lava + water
dense rock - lava + freezing liquid
glowing matter - lava + brine
volcanic rock - lava + blood
toxic rock - lava + toxic sludge
poisonous rock - lava + poison
ice - water + freezing liquid
greed-cursed rock - greed-cursed liquid + lava
hell slime - lava + slime

if you start with mud or can get soil:
mud - soil + water
ground - mud + lava

if you can get urine:
fool's gold - lava + urine
australium - lava + gate-opener

powders:
gold - molten gold + freezing liquid/water
silver - molten silver + freezing liquid/water
copper - molten copper + freezing liquid/water
brass - molten brass + freezing liquid/water
metal dust - molten metal + freezing liquid/water
steel - molten metal (one specific kind) + freezing liquid/water
fungus - lava + green/yellow slime
shock powder - brass + fire (called fungal soil for some reason, quickly forms funky cloud)
guiding powder - flummoxium + unstable teleportatium
sand - fungus blood + diminution
mystery fungus - toxic sludge + fungus blood + diminution (catalyst) + levitatium (neutralizer)
diamond - molten silver + molten copper + blood + freezing liquid (catalyst)
purifying powder - molten brass + diamond + freezing liquid (catalyst) (2 step) 
purifying powder - diamond + silver + worm blood (alternative, 2 step)
gunpowder (unstable) - purifying powder + healing or lava (3 step, much easier to just get this from alchemists!)

unverified:
salt - brine + fire (seems to just duplicate the fire)
soil - excrement + lava (can't remove the nauseating gas which seems to form in excess)

possible but very impractical:
wax - molten wax + freezing liquid/water
plastic - molten plastic + water (freezing liquid doesn't seem to work for some reason)

if you get plant seed (rare potion):
plant material - plant seed + water

liquids (already technically flaskable, but some reactions make it easier):
void liquid - diamond + chaotic polymorphine + toxic sludge (2 step)
chilly water - water + freezing liquid (quickly converts to ice, hard to shift)
slime mist - slime + fire + water (though you could collect this with the spell anyway)
fire - lava + water, lava + oil, unstable teleportatium + flummoxium, etc etc

if you can get urine:
gate-opener - pus + urine + flummoxium

gases:
steam - water + lava
smoke - lots of things...
freezing vapour - freezing liquid + lava
flammable gas - acid + water
toxic gas - toxic sludge + lava
poison gas - poison + lava (quickly becomes fire, hard to shift)
whiskey fumes - whiskey + lava
funky cloud - molten brass + fungus blood + freezing liquid (catalyst)
nauseating gas - excrement + lava
polymorphine cloud - polymorphine + lava
teleportatium cloud - teleportatium + lava (hard to get this as the main material, since it forms freezing vapour as a side product. Seems to help if you jump into lava to add it quickly)
diminution cloud - diminution + lava
healium - healthium/LC + lava
gas of midas - alchemic precursor + lava
fungal gas - green/yellow slime + lava

other
[fire] - whiskey + lava
(many different kinds: spark, flame, fire, electric spark, etc, but quickly reacts to form whiskey fumes)
