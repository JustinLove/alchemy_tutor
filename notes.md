## Pixel Scenes

- can be processed concurrently, starting one before another is finished.
- pixel scenes triggered within a pixel scene are (can be?) processed immediately, before the next pixel in the parent scene
- there can be significant delay in drawing child pixel scenes

    Seems like I remember accomplishing this by messing around with materials_that_create_messages from DamageModelComponent
    okay yeah you just add the material to materials_that_create_messages, and then check if mCollisionMessageMaterials[index of material] is > 0
